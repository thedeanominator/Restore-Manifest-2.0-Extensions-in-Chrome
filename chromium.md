## üìÑ Repository Description

**Restore Manifest V2 Extensions in Chrome**

This repository provides a workaround to continue using Manifest V2 browser extensions in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome, Brave, and Edge) even after Manifest V3 becomes the default. Many extensions‚Äîincluding **uBlock Origin (Legacy MV2)**‚Äîstill rely on Manifest V2 for full functionality, but Google has begun phasing it out.

This repo documents the process of re-enabling support for Manifest V2 via hidden Chrome flags and manually installing extensions in developer mode. The approach is intended for personal use, testing, and preserving functionality of legacy extensions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This is an unsupported method. Future browser updates may break it at any time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Guide: How to Restore Manifest V2 Extensions

### 1. Enable Chrome Flags

1. Open Chrome (or your Chromium-based browser).

2. In the address bar, type:

   ```
   chrome://flags
   ```

   and press **Enter**.

3. In the search bar, type: `unexpire`

   * Locate: **Temporarily unexpire M138 flags**
   * Locate: **Temporarily unexpire M139 flags**
   * Set both to **Enabled**.
   * Click the **Relaunch** button in the bottom right corner.

4. Search again, this time for: `allow legacy`

   * Locate: **Allow legacy extension manifest versions**
   * Set it to **Enabled**.
   * Click **Relaunch**.

### 2. Download & Prepare uBlock Origin (MV2)

1. Visit the official **uBlock Origin GitHub Releases** page.
2. Download the **source code zip** file.
3. Extract (unzip) the file.
4. Rename the extracted folder to:

   ```
   uBlock
   ```
5. Move this folder to a permanent location on your system (since Chrome will always reference it from there).

### 3. Load Extension in Developer Mode

1. In the Chrome address bar, type:

   ```
   chrome://extensions
   ```

   and press **Enter**.

2. In the top right, toggle **Developer mode** to **ON**.

3. Click **Load unpacked**.

4. Navigate to the folder you renamed (`uBlock`) and select it.

The extension will now appear in your list of installed extensions.

### 4. Notes

* The extension will work normally, but you will see a **warning about Manifest V2**.
* This process can be repeated for other Manifest V2 extensions you want to keep.
